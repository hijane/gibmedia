It allows installing different versions of Kafka and has been tested with 0.8.0 and 0.7.0.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nIt was developed on Ubuntu 12.04 but should work on any platform where Java 1.6 works. \n\nThe java cookbook is needed, as usual may be handled with Berkshelf. \n\nAttributes\n----------\n* node['kafka_broker']['version']: Kafka version to be installed, the cookbook has been tested with 0.8.0\n* node['kafka_broker']['scala_version']: Scala version for the binary download, the cookbook has been tested with 2.8.0\n* node['kafka_broker']['tarball_url']: Where to obtain Kafka's source\n* node['kafka_broker']['install_dir']: Where to install Kafka\n* node['kafka_broker']['build_command']: Command to build from source\n\nRunning the tests\n-----------------\n\nThis is done thanks to berkshelf and strainer:\n\n    $ bundle\n    $ bundle exec berks install\n    $ bundle exec strainer test\n\nFor Testkitchen related tests:\n\n    $ bundle\n    $ bundle exec kitchen verify\n    \nVagrant usage\n-------------\n\nFor testing the cookbook with Vagrant 1.2+ you just have to execute bootstrap.sh:\n\n    $ bootstrap.sh\n\nIt installs the required Vagrant plugins and launchs the machine. After the process you have a Kafka broker instance running in ```kafka.local``` host, ip 33.33.33.33 (you may need to provide root privileges to allow vagrant-hostmanager link the previous hostname and ip address).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n1. Fork the repository on Github\n2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)\n3. Write you change\n4. Write tests for your change\n5. Run the tests, ensuring they all pass\n6.
